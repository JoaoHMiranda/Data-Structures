This repository contains implementations of various **data structures** in C++ using templates and best practices. The projects include:

- **Stack** – A stack implemented using a linked list.
- **Queue** – A queue implemented using a linked list.
- **Linked List** – A singly linked list.
- **Circular Doubly Linked List** – A circular doubly linked list.
- **AVL Tree** – A balanced binary search tree (AVL).
- **Red-Black Tree** – A red-black tree implementation.
- **Mirror Tree** – Checks if a binary tree is symmetric.
- **Prefix to Infix** – Converts prefix expressions to infix expressions.
- **Huffman** – A Huffman tree for text encoding/decoding.
- **Burn Tree** – A tree "burn" algorithm using breadth-first search.
- **Binary Tree Max Path Sum** – Calculates the maximum path sum in a binary tree.
